It allows you to enter in a buger, or really anthing you want to enter. The entry is added to the database and a button is created via reloading the page and sending an object from the database into a handlebars file. Clicking the button sends an put request to the database and updates the status of the burger to eaten, then the page is reloaded with the updated list of uneaten burgers with buttons and a list of eaten burgers on the right side of the page.
